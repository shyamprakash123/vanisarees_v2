# Implementation Summary

This document outlines all the features that have been implemented for the e-commerce platform.

## Database Schema Enhancements

### 1. Order-Shipment Integration
- **One-to-One Relationship**: Orders table now has a unique constraint on `shiprocket_shipment_id` ensuring each order can have only one shipment
- **View Created**: `order_details_with_shipment` view combines order and shipment data for easy querying
- **Indexes Added**: Performance indexes on shipment lookups

### 2. Product Approval System
New columns added to products table:
- `admin_approved` (boolean): Approval status
- `approval_notes` (text): Admin feedback for sellers
- `submitted_for_approval_at` (timestamp): Submission timestamp
- `approved_at` (timestamp): Approval timestamp
- `approved_by` (uuid): Admin who approved the product

### 3. Enhanced RLS Policies

#### Orders Table
- Users can only SELECT orders (cannot insert/update/delete directly)
- All order modifications must go through edge functions
- Sellers can view orders for their products
- Admins can view all orders

#### Shipments Table
- Users can view shipments for their own orders
- Sellers can view/manage shipments for their orders
- Admins have full access

#### Products Table
- Public users can only view approved products
- Sellers can view their own products (any status)
- Sellers can only edit unapproved products
- Admins can manage all products

VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

# Supabase (already configured)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Workflow Overview

### Product Lifecycle
1. Seller creates product
2. Seller clicks "Submit for Approval"
3. Product appears in admin approval queue
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects with notes
5. If approved, product becomes visible to customers
6. If rejected, seller can edit and resubmit

### Order Lifecycle
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Customer proceeds to checkout
3. Edge function validates and creates order
4. For online payment: Razorpay order created
5. Customer completes payment
6. Payment verification edge function confirms
7. Order status updated to paid
8. Seller can create Shiprocket shipment
9. Shipment details visible to all parties
10. Customer can cancel before shipment

### Cancellation Flow
1. Customer requests cancellation
2. Edge function validates eligibility

4. Stock restored
5. Order marked as cancelled

## Database Migration File

**Location**: `/supabase/migrations/20251009000001_order_shipment_and_review_enhancements.sql`

This migration must be applied to your database to enable all features. It includes:
- Schema changes for orders and products
- RLS policy updates
- Database functions
- View creation
- Indexes for performance

## Notes

1. **Database Connection**: The database appears to be offline. You'll need to apply the migration manually once the database is accessible.

2. **Edge Function Deployment**: The edge functions need to be deployed to Supabase using the Supabase MCP tools when the database is available.

3. **Testing**: After deployment, test the following:
   - Product submission and approval workflow
   - Order checkout with Razorpay
   - Order cancellation
   - Shipment tracking display

4. **Admin Access**: Ensure admin users have the role 'admin' in the users table.

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Email notifications for approval status
- Webhook for Razorpay payment updates
- Bulk product approval
- Product revision history
- Advanced shipment tracking
