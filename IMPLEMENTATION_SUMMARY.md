# Shiprocket Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A complete Shiprocket API integration built entirely in the frontend (no edge functions) that enables sellers and admins to:

1. **Manage Shiprocket Credentials** - Store and update API credentials
2. **Create Orders in Shiprocket** - Automatically create orders from the platform
3. **Check Courier Serviceability** - View available couriers with pricing and delivery estimates
4. **Assign AWB Numbers** - Automatically assign tracking numbers to shipments
5. **Schedule Pickups** - Automatically schedule pickups with courier partners
6. **Track Shipments** - Store and display tracking information

## Files Created

### Core Utilities
- `src/utils/shiprocket.ts` - Complete Shiprocket API client with all functions

### React Components
- `src/components/shiprocket/ShiprocketManager.tsx` - Main shipment creation workflow
- `src/components/shiprocket/ShiprocketSettings.tsx` - Credentials management interface
- `src/pages/seller/Settings.tsx` - Seller settings page with Shiprocket tab

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/20251008175101_shiprocket_integration.sql` - Database schema
- `SHIPROCKET_SETUP.sql` - Manual setup SQL (run in Supabase SQL Editor)

### Documentation
- `SHIPROCKET_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Updated Files

### Route Configuration
- `src/App.tsx` - Added route for `/seller/settings`

### Order Detail Pages
- `src/pages/admin/OrderDetail.tsx` - Integrated ShiprocketManager component
- `src/pages/seller/OrderDetail.tsx` - Integrated ShiprocketManager component

## Database Schema

### New Tables Created

1. **shiprocket_credentials**
   - Stores Shiprocket API credentials (email/password)
   - Linked to seller accounts
   - Includes pickup location configuration

2. **shiprocket_shipments**
   - Stores all shipment details
   - Links orders to Shiprocket shipment IDs
   - Tracks AWB codes and courier information
   - Stores freight charges and delivery estimates

3. **shiprocket_courier_cache**
   - Caches courier serviceability results
   - Reduces API calls to Shiprocket
   - 1-hour expiration time

### Modified Tables

**orders** table - Added columns:
- `shiprocket_order_id` - Shiprocket's order ID
- `shiprocket_shipment_id` - Shiprocket's shipment ID

## Key Features

### 1. Authentication
- Token-based authentication with Shiprocket API
- Automatic token refresh (10-hour cache)
- Secure credential storage in database

### 2. Courier Selection
- Real-time serviceability check
- Displays multiple courier options with:
  - Pricing (freight + COD charges)
  - Delivery estimates
  - Courier ratings
  - Service type (Surface/Air)
- Visual comparison interface

### 3. Order Creation Workflow
```
1. Check Available Couriers
   ↓
2. Select Preferred Courier
   ↓
3. Create Shiprocket Order
   ↓
4. Assign AWB Number
   ↓
5. Schedule Pickup
   ↓
6. Complete - Order Ready for Shipping
```

### 4. Database Integration
- All shipment data stored in Supabase
- RLS policies for data security
- Audit trail with timestamps
- Metadata storage for additional information

### 5. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Validation at each step
- Fallback handling for API failures
- User-friendly error display

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Sellers can only access their own credentials and shipments
- Admins have full access to all data
- Courier cache accessible to all authenticated users
- All policies enforce authentication

### Data Protection
- Credentials stored encrypted in database
- API tokens cached securely
- No sensitive data in frontend logs

## How It Works

### For Sellers:

1. **Setup Credentials** (One-time)
   - Navigate to `/seller/settings`
   - Enter Shiprocket email and password
   - Configure pickup location name
   - Save credentials

2. **Process Orders**
   - View order at `/seller/order/:id`
   - When order is confirmed, click "Check Available Couriers"
   - Select best courier option based on price and delivery time
   - Click "Create Shipment with Selected Courier"
   - Click "Assign AWB & Schedule Pickup"
   - Order is ready for pickup

3. **Track Shipments**
   - AWB code displayed on order page
   - Order status automatically updated
   - Tracking information available to customers

### For Admins:

Same workflow as sellers, but can manage all orders and view all credentials.

## API Functions Available

All functions in `src/utils/shiprocket.ts`:

```typescript
// Authentication
getAuthToken(credentials): Promise<string>

// Order Management
createShiprocketOrder(credentials, payload): Promise<any>

// Serviceability
checkServiceability(credentials, pickup, delivery, cod, weight, value): Promise<CourierServiceability[]>

// AWB Assignment
assignAWB(credentials, shipmentId, courierId): Promise<any>

// Pickup
generatePickup(credentials, shipmentIds): Promise<any>

// Tracking
trackShipment(credentials, awbCode): Promise<any>
getShipmentDetails(credentials, shipmentId): Promise<any>
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL in `SHIPROCKET_SETUP.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:
- Creates all required tables
- Sets up RLS policies
- Creates indexes for performance
- Adds columns to orders table

### 2. Seller Configuration
Each seller needs to:
- Have a Shiprocket account
- Add at least one pickup location in Shiprocket
- Configure credentials in `/seller/settings`

### 3. Testing
- Create a test order
- Navigate to order detail page
- Follow the shipment creation workflow
- Verify AWB assignment and pickup scheduling

## Integration Points

### With Existing System:

1. **Orders Table** - Extended with Shiprocket references
2. **Seller Dashboard** - New settings tab for credentials
3. **Order Detail Pages** - New shipment management section
4. **Order Status** - Auto-updated during shipment workflow

### External APIs:

1. **Shiprocket API v2** - All operations via REST API
2. **Authentication** - OAuth-style token authentication
3. **Rate Limiting** - Handles with caching strategy

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Token Caching** - 10-hour cache reduces auth calls
2. **Courier Cache** - 1-hour cache for serviceability checks
3. **Lazy Loading** - Components load only when needed
4. **Optimistic Updates** - UI updates before API confirmation

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Bulk shipment creation
- Shipping label PDF generation
- Return order management
- NDR (Non-Delivery Report) handling
- Shipment cancellation
- Rate calculator for checkout
- Automated weight calculation
- Manifest generation for pickups
